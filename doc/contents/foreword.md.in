# Foreword {#foreword}

OpenFLUID is a software environment for spatial modelling in landscapes, mainly focused on fluxes.
It is developed by the LISAH (Laboratory of Interactions Soil-Agrosystem-Hydrosystem, Montpellier, France) 
which is a joint research unit between INRA (French National Institute for Agricultural Research), 
IRD (French Institute for Research and Development) and Montpellier SupAgro (International Centre for Higher Education in Agricultural Sciences).

This documentation is made of several parts
* a guide for running simulations using OpenFLUID, including the construction of input datasets
* a guide for development of OpenFLUID simulators, either using existing source code or creating source code _de novo_ 
* an appendix giving useful reference informations

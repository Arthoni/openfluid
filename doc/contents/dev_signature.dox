\page dev_signature Declaration of the simulator signature

The signature can be automatically generated through the OpenFLUID plugin for Eclipse.
However it is possible to write the signature \e de \e novo, or complete it manually.

The signature has to be defined between the #BEGIN_SIMULATOR_SIGNATURE and the #END_SIMULATOR_SIGNATURE macros.  

\section dev_signature_id Identification

The identification part of the signature must contain at least the ID of the simulator. 
This ID will be used by the framework to load simukators. It is declared in 
the signature as an agrument of the #BEGIN_SIMULATOR_SIGNATURE macro.\n 
Other optional informations can be included for better description of the simulator:
<ul>
<li>the simulator name, declared through the #DECLARE_NAME macro,
allowing to assign a long name to the simulator
<li>the simulator description, declared through the #DECLARE_DESCRIPTION macro,
allowing to provide a detailed description of what the simulator actually does 
<li>the name(s) of the author(s) and it email address, declared through the #DECLARE_AUTHOR macro.
There may be multiple #DECLARE_AUTHOR macros in the signature in case of multiple authors
<li>the software version of the simulator, declared through the #DECLARE_VERSION macro
<li>the software status of the simulator, declared through the #DECLARE_STATUS macro. The value can be
openfluid::base::EXPERIMENTAL, openfluid::base::BETA or openfluid::base::STABLE
</ul>

See the \ref dev_signature_exmpl part for detailed example. 


\section dev_signature_sci Informations about scientific application

The informations about scientific applications is only indicative.
It has no effects on simulator consistency or computational code.
These information can be :
<ul>
<li> the domain in which the simulator can be applied, declared through the #DECLARE_DOMAIN macro
<li> the processes simulated by the simulator, declared through the #DECLARE_PROCESS macro
<li> the numerical methods used by the simulator, declared through the #DECLARE_METHOD macro
</ul>

\section dev_signature_data Data and spatial graph 

The data used by the simulators can be:
<ul>
<li> Simulator parameters, and can only be accessed by the simulator
<li> Spatial attributes that are attached to spatial units, giving properties about the spatial units
<li> Simulation variables that are attached to spatial units, representing the dynamics of modeled processes
over the spatial units
<li> Discrete events that are attached to spatial units, 
representing the events occuring at a given date and time on a given spatial unit
<li> Specific file(s) loaded by the simulator 
</ul>
These data can be accessed, appended and/or modified by the simulator.\n
\n
The spatial graph representing the landscape can also be accessed or modified 
by simulators during simulations.\n 
\n
The declarations of spatial data access include rules:
<ul>
<li>REQUIRED, this means that the data must be available or already produced
<li>USED, this means that the data are used only if they are available or already produced
</ul> 

\subsection dev_signature_data_simparams Simulators parameters

Simulators parameters are values provided to each simulator, 
and are declared using the #DECLARE_SIMULATOR_PARAM macro.
This macro takes 3 arguments
<ul>
<li>the name of the parameter
<li>the description of the parameter (may be empty)
<li>the SI unit of the parameter (may be empty)
</ul>

Example of simulator parameter declaration:
\code
  DECLARE_SIMULATOR_PARAM("meanspeed","mean speed to use","m/s")
\endcode
\n

\subsection dev_signature_data_attrs Spatial attributes

Spatial attributes are constant properties attached to each spatial units, 
and are declared using #DECLARE_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE or #DECLARE_USED_ATTRIBUTE macros

These macros take 4 arguments:
<ul>
<li>the name of the attribute
<li>the units class
<li>the description of the attribute (may be empty)
<li>the SI unit of the attribute (may be empty)
</ul>

Example of attributes declaration:
\code
  DECLARE_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE("area","TU","area of the Test Units","m")
  DECLARE_USED_ATTRIBUTE("landuse","OU","landuse of the Other Units","")
\endcode
\n


\subsection dev_signature_data_vars Simulation variables

Simulation variables are attached to spatial units. They are produced, accessed and modified
by simulators during simulations.\n
Accessed variables are declared using #DECLARE_REQUIRED_VAR or #DECLARE_USED_VAR macros,
produced variables are declared using #DECLARE_PRODUCED_VAR macro, 
updated variables are declared using #DECLARE_UPDATED_VAR macro.

These macros take 4 arguments:
<ul>
<li>the name of the variable
<li>the concerned unit class
<li>the description of the variable (may be empty)
<li>the SI unit of the variable (may be empty)
</ul>

These variables can be typed or untyped. 
When they are declared in the signature, the variables names suffixed by the [] symbol with a type name enclosed
are typed, i.e. each value for the variable must match the type of the variable.
If no type is mentioned, values for the variable can be of any type.\n
In case of typed variables, the type of a required or used variable by a simulator
must match the type of the variable set when it is produced.   

The type name for a declaration of a variable can be:
<ul>
<li> \c boolean for boolean values
<li> \c integer for long integer values
<li> \c double for double precision values
<li> \c string for string values
<li> \c vector for vector data
<li> \c matrix for matrix data
<li> \c map for associative keys-value data
</ul>

These scenarios of variable exchanges between two simulators run successfully:
<ul>
<li> simulator A produced an \e untyped variable var1,
simulator B requires/uses/updates an \e untyped variable var1
<li> simulator A produced a \e typed variable var1, 
simulator B requires/uses/updates an \e untyped variable var1
<li> simulator A produced a \e typed variable var1 of type \c double, 
simulator B requires/uses/updates a \e typed variable var1 of type \c double
</ul>

These scenarios of variable exchanges between two simulators are failing:
<ul>
<li> simulator A produced an \e untyped variable var1, 
simulator B requires/uses/updates a \e typed variable var1
<li> simulator A produced a \e typed variable var1 of type \c double, 
simulator B requires/uses/updates a \e typed variable var1 of type \c matrix 
</ul>

Example of variables declarations
\code  
  DECLARE_REQUIRED_VAR("varA[double]","TU","","m")
  DECLARE_USED_VAR("varB","OU","simple var on Other Units","kg")
  DECLARE_PRODUCED_VAR("VarB[vector]","TU","vectorized var on Test Units","kg")
  DECLARE_UPDATED_VAR("VarC","TU","","")
\endcode


\subsection dev_signature_data_events Discrete events

Discrete events are attached to spatail units, They are accessed or appended by simulators during simulations,
and are declared using the #DECLARE_USED_EVENTS macro.\n

The declaration macro takes 1 argument: the units class.

Example of events declaration:
\code
  DECLARE_USED_EVENTS("TU")
\endcode


\subsection dev_signature_data_extrafiles Extra files

Simulators can declare files that they load and manage. This helps users to provide the needed files, and also  
notifiesthe OpenFLUID framework to check the presence of the file if it is required.\n 
These files are declared using the #DECLARE_USED_EXTRAFILE or #DECLARE_REQUIRED_EXTRAFILE macros. 

The declaration macro takes 1 argument: the file name with relative path to the dataset path.

Example of extra file declarations:
\code
  DECLARE_USED_EXTRAFILE("fileA.dat")
  DECLARE_REQUIRED_EXTRAFILE("geo/zone.shp")
\endcode


\subsection dev_signature_data_spatial Spatial units graph

The spatial units graph representing the landscape can be modified by simulators.
These modifications are declared in the signature function using two macros.\n
 
The #DECLARE_UPDATED_UNITSGRAPH macro is used for declaration of the global units graph modification
that will occur during simulation. 
It is for information purpose only, and takes a description as a single arguments.\n
 
The #DECLARE_UPDATED_UNITSCLASS macro is used for declaration of units classes that will be affected, and how.
It takes two arguments:
<ul>
<li>the units class
<li>the description of the update (may be empty)
</ul>   

Example of declarations for spatial units graph:
\code
  DECLARE_UPDATED_UNITSGRAPH("update of the spatial graph for ...")
  DECLARE_UPDATED_UNITSCLASS("TU","")
\endcode

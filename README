OpenFLUID-engine sources
========================

The OpenFLUID-engine source tree is organized as follow
- doc/manuals : latex sources of the manuals
- doc/API-doxygen : doxygen files for API documentation
- doc/examples : latex sources of the examples documentation
- include : include files of the API
- resources/dist : files to include in packages for distribution
- resources/examples : examples of simulation functions, with build system files
- resources/func2doc : func2doc buddy resources files
- resources/graphics : source graphics used in documentation
- src/kernel : sources of the kernel
- src/ofelib : sources of the support library and API
- tests : data, sources and configuration for testing using CTest


The required libraries are:
for ofelib: 
  - C++ STL
  - boost (system, filesystem) 
for the kernel: 
  - ofelib 
  - C++ STL
  - boost (system, filesystem, program_options, date_time)
  - libxml2

For unit testing, the boost test framework is also required (unit_test_framework)


For building Latex documents, required tools and packages are:
- pdflatex
- latex2html
- packages: a4wide, babel, ltxtable, pgf/tikz, tabularx, verbatim
- fonts: cmbright


In order to build the binaries and pack the application, CMake 2.6.x 
is required.
1) create a directory named "_build" (or any other name)
2) "cd" to this directory
3) run "cmake .."    
4) run "make"
5) run "ctest" to run tests


To build packages, 
1) "cd" to the "_build" directory
2) run "cpack"

\section{General information about file formats}

\textbf{TODO or TOREMOVE}

\section{Date-time formats used in outputs configuration}

The output.xml file can use the ANSI strftime() standards formats for date time, through a format string. 
The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifications and ordinary characters.
A conversion specification consists of a \% character and a terminating conversion character that determines the conversion specification's behaviour.
All ordinary characters (including the terminating null byte) are copied unchanged into the array.

\bigskip

For example, the nineteenth of April, two-thousand seven, at eleven hours, ten minutes and twenty-five seconds formatted using different format strings:
\begin{itemize}
\item "\verb|%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S|" will give "\verb|19/04/2007 10:11:25|"
\item "\verb|%Y-%m-%d %H.%M|" will give "\verb|2007-04-19 10.11|"
\item "\verb|%Y\t%m\t%d\t%H\t%M\t%S|" will give "\verb|2007	04	19	10	11	25|"
\end{itemize}

\%d & is replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number [01,31]. \\
\%D & same as \%m/\%d/\%y. \\
\%e & is replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number [1,31]; a single digit is preceded by a space. \\
\%h & same as \%b. \\
\%H & is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number [00,23]. \\
